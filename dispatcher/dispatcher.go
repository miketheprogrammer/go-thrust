RunLoop starts a loop that receives CommandResponses and dispatches them.
This is a helper method, but you could just implement your own, if you only
need this loop to be the blocking loop.
For Instance, in a HTTP Server setting, you might want to run this as a
goroutine and then let the servers blocking handler keep the process open.
As long as there are commands in the channel, this loop will dispatch as fast
as possible
